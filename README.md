# Mini-Artify-3D-Printer-
Designed a low-cost, compact FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer to make additive manufacturing accessible in resource-constrained settings, with integrated PET plastic recycling for sustainability.
This project was my final year capstone project, which I completed with three of my classmates while pursuing my BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) at East West University, Bangladesh.
